=======================
The ``lino-xl`` package
=======================





The **Lino Extensions Library** is a collection of plugins used by
many Lino projects.

This package is written and maintained by the same author, but not
part of the Lino core because it adds a given set of solutions for
"Enterprise" style applications.  It is documented together with the
core at http://www.lino-framework.org
